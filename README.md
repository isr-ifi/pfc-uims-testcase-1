# Visual-Components-Testcase
This Repository is part of my Master's thesis. You can find the main thesis Repository in the Github Repository *Configuration-System*: https://github.com/sarahzu/Configuration-System

This Repository contains a collection of visual components (plots or similar visualisations) which are used as test-cases for the main Master's thesis project. Because this Repository is only used for testing the main project, it is held very simple. Each file contains a visualisation of a pie or donut chart. The folders *in* and *out* hold demo data sets used to create the visualisations.

For more information about my Master's thesis, please visit the main thesis Repository.
